# Hackathon-
In this project, we developed a data-driven solution to analyze and visualize sales data, providing actionable insights for marketing teams. 
in other to provide actionable insight for the marketing team we needed to encode some columns in our data set, as the only language the machine understands is only binary that is 0s and 1s encoding has to be done to convert text entries in our columns into machine readerble form that is 0s and 1s for us go further with our analysis 
we also gave out insight or recommendations grom the visualization and analysis
